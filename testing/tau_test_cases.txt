# Tau-specific Test Cases for European General Aviation
# Format: 3 lines per test case
# Line 1: Traffic aircraft (Latitude, Longitude, Altitude, Track, speed in kts, vertical speed in ft/min)
# Line 2: Own aircraft (Latitude, Longitude, Altitude, Track, speed in kts, vertical speed in ft/min)
# Line 3: Expected result (RA, TA, potential_collision, no_collision, unclear)

# === Tau = 240 seconds (4 minutes) - Should NOT trigger (collision threshold is 180s) ===
