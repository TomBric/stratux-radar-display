# stratux-radar-display
Implementation of a standalone Radar display for Stratux Europe Edition. Can run on a separate Raspberry (e.g. Zero W or Zero 2 W). Reads the aircraft data from Stratux and displays them on the specified display. You can connect 3 pushbuttons to the device and use them for changing the radar radius, the height difference and sound options. A clock with a stop and lap timer, a g-meter, an artificial horizon, a compass (based on GPS) and a VSI display are also implemented.

- update in version 1.4: external sound connection is now supported by using a USB sound card (approx. 4 Euro). With that you can connect your display to your intercom. This external sound output is also functioning on the stratux only, without an additional Zero.
- update in version 1.5: the display now also supports an automatic logging of your flight times. Flight time is started when your GPS speed is 5 seconds more than 30 kts and stopped if you are 5 seconds below 10 kts. When you stopped the airplane (below 5 kts) the display will automatically show the 8 latest flights. This can be disabled with the option "-nf". You can also switch via pressing middle button ("Mode") several times to the flight display mode. 
- update in version 1.6: an additional epaper display is now supported (1.54 epaper Waveshare module 12955 or 12561+hat). This is a good option for the oled display. Perfect visibility in sunlight, but slower than the oled. Can be used in 2 1/4 instrument holes.
- update in version 1.7: optional CO sensor is supported (see wiki)
- update in version 1.8: integration of distance sensor and calculation of start/landing distances
- update in version 1.9: adding mode selection parameter and start/landing distance calculation with ultrasonic sensor

Current supported displays are:
- Oled Display 1.5 inch (waveshare)
- Epaper Display 3.7 inch (waveshare)
- Epaper Display 1.54 inch (waveshare)

More displays can be integrated.
You can find instructions how to build the full instruments in the wiki. The Oled-case is designed for a 2 1/4 inch mounting hole, the E-paper case is designed for a 3 1/8 inch (80 mm) mounting hole. Instructions e.g. how to build an [all-in one 2 1/4 Oled case](https://github.com/TomBric/stratux-radar-display/wiki/All-in-one-aluminum-case-(Stratux-with-oled-display) "wiki 2 1/4"), or [all-in-one 3 1/8 Epaper instrument](https://github.com/TomBric/stratux-radar-display/wiki/All-in-one-aluminum-case-for-80-mm-instrument-hole-with-Epaper-display-and-Bluetooth "wiki 3 1/8"), or [Epaper 3 1/8 display only](https://github.com/TomBric/stratux-radar-display/wiki/Epaper-Display-for-80-mm-instrument-hole) can be found in the wiki.

Find below a photo of the current supported displays
- the oled display is relatively small, but can be build into a 2 1/4" or larger instrument mounting hole
- the epaper display is larger and has optimal readability in sunlight. As e-paper it has a slower update of approx. twice per second. For the radar display this update rate is appropriate

## Hardware-List
- Raspberry Hardware: Since the code is pure python, no special hardware is required. I recommend a current "raspbian standard desktop os" as operating system. Performance requirements are not so high, so I recommend a "Rasperry Zero or Zero 2 W 512MByte RAM". Normal Raspberry 3B or 4 are also possible. The Raspi Zero has the smallest form factor and best battery consumption. 
- Waveshare 18381 3.7inch e-Paper Display + Waveshare Universal e-Paper Raw Panel Driver HAT 13512. Please make sure to switch the "Display Config" switch to A.
(Alternatively Waveshare 18057 3.7inch e-Paper HAT: Directly mountable on the Raspi as a HAT, if you buy an Raspi Zero WH, but then you can't connect the buttons).

 - Optional power supply suggestion: If you need a reliable display power supply in your airplane, I have good experiences with small step-down converters LM2596. Then you can use the aircraft power supply (up to 40V). Calibrate the LM2596 at home for a power output at 5 V e.g. using an old laptop power supply. LM2596 also work well for the stratux itself. If you encounter problems with radio noise, please ensure that the power cable to the display is twisted and if necessary use a ferrit-core at the power connection.

## Software Installation Instructions
### Standard setup
   1. Download the image under Releases/Assets to your local computer. Image with "oled" is preconfigured for the Oled 1.5 inch display. Image with "epaper_3in7" is the version for the waveshare 3.7 inch epaper display, "epaper_1in54" for the smaller epaper. Both versions will support Bluetooth
   2. Flash the image using Raspberry Pi Imager (select "OwnImage") or Win32DiskImager to your SD card (32 GB cards recommended)
   3. Insert the SD into you raspberry and let it boot. It should automatically startup and connect to the Stratux-Europe edition. 
   Remark: Current configuration is for Stratux-Europe on IP address 192.168.10.1. using wifi SSID "stratux". If you have a different configuration please update the stratux IP in /home/pi/stratux-radar-display/image/stratux_radar.sh accordingly. To change the wifi network use a modified wpa_supplicant.conf or use the "Display status" mode with the pushbuttons (expert only).
   
### Expert setup 
   1. Configure a clean Raspbian installation on your SD card. E.g. using Raspberry Pi Imager. Image to flash is the standard image "Raspbian Pi OS (recommended)". 
   2. Setup your main stratux in the following way:  Install version eu-027 on ther stratux or newer. Go to "Settings" and set Wifi-Mode: AP+Client. Enable "Internet-Passthrough" as well. Then "Add wifi client network" and add the data of your local home network. This all enables your stratux to have Internet connection and gives the display the possibility to access internet as well. 
   3. Startup your Stratux and boot your new raspberry. Connect your PC/workstation to the standard "stratux" wifi network and figure out the IP-adress of your display-raspberry, e.g. by using "arp -a".
   4. From your workstation open a remote shell on the display-raspberry:  ssh pi@192.168.x.x. Password is standard for the pi.
   5. Clone the stratux-radar-display repository by the command: "git clone https://github.com/TomBric/stratux-radar-display.git"
   6. Execute the configuration script as user pi. "/bin/bash /home/pi/stratux-radar-display/image/configure_radar.sh".  This will take some time since it does an update on the pi. 
   7. Depending on your display modify /home/pi/stratux-radar-display/image/stratux_radar.sh. In paramater "-c" enter the IP address of your stratux and in parameter "-d" the device. E.g.
         - cd /home/pi/stratux-radar-display/main && python3 radar.py -b -d Oled_1in5 -c 192.168.10.1 &            
         - cd /home/pi/stratux-radar-display/main && python3 radar.py -b -r -d Epaper_3in7 -c 192.168.10.1 & 
         - cd /home/pi/stratux-radar-display/main && python3 radar.py -b -r -d Epaper_1in54 -c 192.168.10.1 & 
   8. The configuration skript will make an entry in crontab of user pi, so that radar will start automatically after reboot. 

   
### Installation on a standard stratux device (for stratux versions eu027 or newer!)
   stratux-radar-display can run also directly on your stratux device. You can find an example of a case with everything installed in the [wiki](https://github.com/TomBric/stratux-radar-display/wiki/All-in-one-aluminum-case-(Stratux-with-oled-display)). Connect the displays to the GPIO pins of the Stratux. 
   Installation is only for expert users! To install the software perform the following steps:
   
   1. Connect your stratux to a network, e.g. by integrating into your WLAN: go to "Settings" and add your local wifi network.
   This will connect your stratux to your local wlan. Alternatively connect Stratux via network cable.
   2. Enable a writeable persistent filesystem in the settings tab by setting "Persistent Logging". 
   3. Reboot and log on to your Stratux as user pi, directory /home/pi
   4. Clone the stratux repository by "git clone https://github.com/TomBric/stratux-radar-display.git"
   5. Execute the configuration skript: "/bin/bash /home/pi/stratux-radar-display/image/configure_radar_on_stratux.sh". It will take some time.
   6. The script configures stratux to work with the Oled display and without bluetooth or external sound. So if this is your configuration, you are fine. Otherwise you can configure the startup skript "image/stratux_radar.sh": Check that the bluetooth option is not specified (no "-b") and use the corresponding display option with "-d Oled_1in5",  "-d Epaper_3in7" or "-d Epaper_1in54". You can use a simple editor like nano for this: "nano image/stratux_radar.sh". 
   7. Reboot stratux. If everything if installed correctly, the display software will automatically startup.

The Oled display uses different GPIO-Pins as the baro-sensor, so there is no conflict. Also the e-Paper display can be connected (not the HAT version) with the baro and ahrs sensors in place.
- Remark: Bluetooth is currently not properly supported by Stratux, so if you want audio output to your headset, please use an additional Raspberry Zero 2 W or Zero W for the display.
- Remark: The ogn receiver is potentially conflicting with connection lines of the Epaper-display. Starting with Stratux 
Version EU28 there is a setting availabe to resolve the conflict: Go to Stratux settings and disable "OGN Transmission via I²C/GPIO HAT".
   
### External Sound output
   
   You can connect your stratux device with your intercom if it has an input for external audio (e.g. TQ KRT2 has one). This is possible on the Pi Zero or the PI3B with an external USB sound card (using the builtin headphone output does not work on the Pi3B). I used a simple "3D USB 5.1 Sound card" available for 4 Euro. The sound volume can be controlled via the option "-y 50" or can be modified with the pushbuttons under ->Status-> Net/Opt -> External Volume.
   The following link gives some good hints, which USB sound card can be used and it also shows how to solder it to the Pi Zero, if you do not want an adapter or space is an issue (https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2019/06/using-a-usb-audio-device-with-the-raspberry-pi/)
   
### Bluetooth devices
   
   stratux-radar-display will automatically connect the your headset if their bluetooth is switched on. 
   But once you need to do the pairing of a new bluetooth device. 
   
   There are two options for pairing:
   
   **Option 1: Directly on the device via buttons:**
   
   * Change to Status-Mode (long press middle button, to change from Radar-> Timer -> AHRS -> G-Meter -> Compass -> VSI -> Status)
   * Press "scan" (right button). The display now scans 30 secs for new devices. Set your headset as visible and it will be detected (For Bose A20 this is a 5 second press on the Bluetooth-Button until it flashes blue-red)
   * A list of detected devices is shown, press "yes" for the detected device. Sometimes you need to repeat the scan until your headset is detected.
      
   **Option 2: via ssh and bluetoothctl**
   
   * Logon on your radar as user pi:  ssh pi@192.168.x.x
   * Start bluetoothctl:   
   ```
      -> bluetoothctl
      -> scan on      set your device in pairing mode (for Bose A20, do a 5 sec press on the bluetooth button until it flashes magenta)
      -> wait till your device is displayed, this will look like:  
            [NEW] Device 04:52:C7:02:C0:01 Bose A20,              04:52:C7:02:C0:01 is the device id, which will be different for you
      -> scan off
      -> trust <device-id>   <replace with your device id>
      -> pair <device-id>, eventually your pin is requested (for Bose A20 enter "0000")
      -> connect <device-id>
   If everything works fine, the pi displays connected and your device name.
      -> exit
   ```
   
   The bluetooth configuration is now ready and each time the radar has your device in reachability, it will connect. On the display the bluetooth symbol will be visible in the right corner.

### In all screen modes:
   - middle button (>1 sec): switch to next mode (radar -> timer -> ahrs -> gmeter -> compass -> vertical speed -> display status -> stratux statux -> flight logs -> radar)
   - left button (>1 sec): start shutdown, press any other button to cancel shutdown
   - after shutdown, display can be reactivated by switching on/off
   - Epaper display: right button > 1 sec does a refresh of the display. Sometimes you may have some fragments on the display (because we are using partial refresh). Pressing the right button does a full refresh.
   
### Radar screen mode:
   - left button short: change radar range (2nm -> 5nm -> 10nm -> 40nm)
   - middle button short: enable/disable sound (if bluetooth speaker/headset is connected)
   - right button short: change height difference for traffic (1000ft -> 2000 ft -> 5000 ft -> 10k ft -> 50k ft)
   - right button long: screen refresh. This is relevant for Epaper only since it becomes "dirty" over time with partial refresh.
